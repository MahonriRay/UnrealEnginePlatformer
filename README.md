# Overview

The goal for this project was to familiarize myself with the Unreal Engine so that when I do projects in the future that I have planned I won't be going in as blind as I was with this simple project.  

This game is a really simple 2D platformer. It has the tools to develop worlds with a medieval fantasy theme and can easily be done so now that I have the general foundation built and can easily create as many Maps(levels/worlds) as I can imagine.  
  
As I've stated before, the purpose of this software was for me, as well as others to see what the flow of the Unreal Engine is like. The game I've created is by no means a marvel and can easily be more fleshed out, but it greatly shows how all of the working components mesh together in order to create a game such as this. From here on out, the building blocks of Unreal only become more useful and can accomplish many outstanding goals that I may have. All of which would more than likely not be possible if I first didn't do the extremely simple projects to demonstrate the power of Unreal

# Development Environment

The tools used for this project were the Unreal Engine and it's default IDE that comes from the Epic Games Launcher  

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
The languege I used for this project is C++ as is it what the blueprints for this engine are written in. The process of mapping out blueprints and classes is very intuitive and simple with a great visual that showcases how all of the objects and classes are connected.
